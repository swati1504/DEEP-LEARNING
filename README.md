# DEEP-LEARNING PROJECTS

## This repository is intended for my deep learning projects.
## The projects are MNIST, CLASSIFICATION OF DOGS VS CATS, LOAN DATA ANALYSIS and the rest of the repositories are intended for my practice of Tflearn, Pytorch, building CNNs.
### The dataset of the CLASSIFICATION OF DOGS VS CATS has been retrieved from Kaggle, I have placed a link below to it
## https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data

## The projects make use of keras, tensorflow, pytorch, building DNNs, CNNs and RNNs and all the processes that are involved in building the model thereby depicting a comprehensive understanding of all the required topics.

### All of the projects have been done on Jupyter notebook.
